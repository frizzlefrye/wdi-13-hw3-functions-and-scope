// 1. Verbal questions

// a parameter is a variable that lives inside of a method
// an argument is the value of after its been passed through the method
// is it possible then to have your parameter and agrument be the same?
// thats what it looks like in my Palindrome?

// return is giving you the value of the function 
// where console.log is just showing the output in the console

// Other than returing a function value you can reuse it, pass it through an argument?
